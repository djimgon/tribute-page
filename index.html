      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of club career:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sporting CP</strong>. At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[40] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.</li>
        <li><strong>Manchester United (2003–2007: Development and breakthrough)</strong>. Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[52] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[53] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[54] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[55] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."</li>
        <li><strong>Real Madrid</strong>. On the eve of the 2009/10 season, Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid for a record transfer amount at that time - 80 million pounds (94 million euros).[129] His contract, which lasted until 2015, was worth 11 million euros per year and contained a 1 billion euro buyout clause.[130] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabeu, breaking the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who welcomed Diego Maradona to Napoli.[131] Since club captain Raul already wore the number 7 (the same number that Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received a T-shirt with the number 9[132], which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stefano[133].</li>
        <li><strong>Juventus</strong>. Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[248] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs.[249] The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[250] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[251] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[252] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[253]</li>
        <li><strong>Return to Manchester United</strong>. On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[307][308] The transfer was for an initial £12.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.[309] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[310] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[311]</li>
        <li><strong>Al Nassr</strong>. On 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.[346] As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth €200 million per year;[347][348] this included an annual guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to €200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of €100 million.[349] According to media reports, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.[350]</li>
